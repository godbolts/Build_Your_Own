# Build Your Own

The idea is to build various small projects that are found in codecrafters build-your-own-x repository: https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x. The projects will be built using the Python, Golang and Java programming languages. The simple idea is to save a lot of code for later reference.

## First Project - Go Shell

A simple Golang program through which shell can be used. very rudimentary but will serve well as an example of how user inputs can be managed.
