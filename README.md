# Build Your Own

The idea is to build different small projects that are found in codecrafters build-your-own-x repository: https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x. The projects will be built using the Python, Golang and Java programming languages. They will range in complxity and size. The simple idea is to retrain large amounts of code for later reference.

## First Project - Go Shell

A simple Golang program through wich shell can be used. very rudimentary but will serve well as an example of how user inputs can be managed.
